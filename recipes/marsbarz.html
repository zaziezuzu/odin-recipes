        <p>This is Mars in a show of self-restraint when being offered a full plate of his favorite treats.</p>
        
        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Delicious treats your pup will devour. These treats are super easy to make and this recipe yields a ton of them. These treats are all natural, so it's recommended to keep them fresh in the refrigerator or in the freezer for long-term storage.</p>
